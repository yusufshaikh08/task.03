    <p>CSS was first proposed by<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie" title="Håkon Wium Lie" class="link1">Håkon Wium lie</a></span> on 10 October 1994.<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#cite_note-chss-proposal-23" class="link2">[23]</a></span> At the time, Lie was working with <span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee" class="link3">Tim Berners-Lee</a></span> at <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN" title="CERN" class="link4">CERN</a></span>.[24] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium" title="World Wide Web Consortium" class="link5">World Wide Web Consortium</a></span> resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[25] being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos" title="Bert Bos" class="link6" >Bert Bos</a></span>  was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[26]

    </p>
    <p>Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup 
        Language  <sapn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language" class="link" title="(SGML)">(SGML)</a></sapn> in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[27] One requirement
         for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore,
          existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document'
          s style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.[27]</p>

            The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS
            level 1, resulting <br>in the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997.It was published as a W3C Recommendation <br>on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3,
            which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.
            
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            In 2005, the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly.<br>
             This meant that already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors, and CSS 3<br> Text were pulled back from CandidateRecommendation to Working Draft level.

            <p> <h4> dependency :</h4>
                Since HTML is a markup language to define the web pages structure or organization, the same format and syntax cannot be used in CSS sheets. On the other hand CSS is independent of HTML and will be usable with many of the markup languages which are XML-based.
             </p>
             <p>
                <h4> support :</h4>
                The core strength of the HTML’s growth and becoming the default standard in web development has been the large community of the supporters who focus on developing different web page structures and revised approaches.  Undoubtedly, CSS does have a strong community of support as well as backup to ensure improvements in the web designing on an ongoing process.
