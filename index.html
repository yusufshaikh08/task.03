    <p>CSS was first proposed by<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie" title="Håkon Wium Lie" class="link1">Håkon Wium lie</a></span> on 10 October 1994.<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#cite_note-chss-proposal-23" class="link2">[23]</a></span> At the time, Lie was working with <span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee" class="link3">Tim Berners-Lee</a></span> at <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN" title="CERN" class="link4">CERN</a></span>.[24] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium" title="World Wide Web Consortium" class="link5">World Wide Web Consortium</a></span> resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[25] being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos" title="Bert Bos" class="link6" >Bert Bos</a></span>  was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[26]

    <p>Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup 
        Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[27] One requirement
         for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore,
          existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document'
          s style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.[27]</p>

                The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1,
                 resulting in the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation 
                 on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.
